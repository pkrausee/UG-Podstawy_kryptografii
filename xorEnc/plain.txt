thou knowst the mask of night is
 on my face else would a maiden 
blush be paint my cheek for that
 which thou hast heard me speak 
tonight fain would i dwell on fo
rm fain fain deny what i have sp
oke but farewell compliment dost
 thou love me i know thou wilt s
ay ay and i will take thy word y
et if thou swearst thou mayst pr
ove false at lovers perjuries th
en say jove laughs o gentle rome
o if thou dost love pronounce it
 faithfully or if thou thinkst i
 am too quickly won ill frown an
d be perverse an say thee nay so
 thou wilt woo but else not for 
the world in truth fair montague
 i am too fond and therefore tho
u mayst think my behavior light 
but trust me gentleman ill prove
 more true than those that have 
more cunning to be strange i sho
uld have been more strange i mus
t confess but that thou overhear
dst ere i was ware my true loves
